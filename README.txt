Contributing:

Everyone and everything is welcome, just please consider the following:

* Currently we are removing the honorifics. Not against them but just keep it consistent.
* All instances of "Sortie" should be changed to "Deploy/Deployment".
* Characters, depending on context are either "allies" or "friends".
* Item cards are called "Tool cards".
* Color tags should be on the same words as in the original.
* In most cases the game can set line breaks (\n) automatically, so it's safe to remove them.
